# Inscription-Search-Engine
This page is dedicated to the search engine for inscriptions (ISE) implemented on the portal of the [EAGLE project](http://www.eagle-network.eu/).
The two interfaces of the search engine can be tested here:
* [Basic Search](http://www.eagle-network.eu/basic-search/)
* [Advanced Search](http://www.eagle-network.eu/advanced-search)

You won't find any code here *yet*, but we'll see to that...
